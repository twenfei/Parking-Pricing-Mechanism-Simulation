#Parking pricing mechanism simulation
In our project, we model the parking allocation problem with rational agents who tries to maximize their own utility, and we propose three different pricing mechanisms for a parking lot. We simulate these mechanisms under with varied number of agents, number of slots and probabilistic models, and decide the best pricing mechanism for the parking lot based on the result.
